## üåê About the Project

This system aims to enhance the restaurant experience for both customers and staff by improving ingredient management, streamlining ordering processes, and providing valuable customer feedback channels.

---

## üöÄ Features

### Ingredient Management

- **Ingredient Records**: The system diligently records the status of ordered and leftover ingredients for each time frame. 
- **Efficiency Enhancement**: This serves as a pivotal reference for future ingredient orders, ensuring optimal utilization and addressing issues of excess or deficit.

### Pre-Ordering System

- **Streamlined Experience**: Reduce customer wait time by allowing them to pre-order their meals.
- **Staff Efficiency**: Prepare meals in advance based on pre-orders to optimize kitchen and staff workflows.

### Customer Feedback System

- **Communication Bridge**: Acts as a direct channel to engage and interact with customers, addressing the prior gap in customer communication.
- **Menu Design Feedback**: Collect reviews and understand customer preferences to influence future menu designs, focusing on increasing dishes with higher satisfaction rates.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
